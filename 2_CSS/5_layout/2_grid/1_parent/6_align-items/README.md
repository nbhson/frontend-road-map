# align-items

Aligns grid items along the block (column) axis (as opposed to justify-items which aligns along the inline (row) axis). This value applies to all grid items inside the container.

Values:
- stretch – fills the whole height of the cell (this is the default)
- start – aligns items to be flush with the start edge of their cell
- end – aligns items to be flush with the end edge of their cell
- center – aligns items in the center of their cell
- baseline – align items along text baseline. There are modifiers to baseline — first baseline and last baseline which will use the baseline from the first or last line in the case of multi-line text.

```scss
.container {
  align-items: start | end | center | stretch;
}
```
