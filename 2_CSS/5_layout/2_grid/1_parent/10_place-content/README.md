# place-content

place-content sets both the align-content and justify-content properties in a single declaration.

Values:
- <align-content> / <justify-content> â€“ The first value sets align-content, the second value justify-content. If the second value is omitted, the first value is assigned to both properties.

```scss
.container {
  place-content: start | end | center | stretch | space-around | space-between | space-evenly;    
}
```
