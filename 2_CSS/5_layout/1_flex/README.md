# Flex

## What's Flexbox

When you're building a house, you need a blueprint. In the same way, we need a blueprint when we're making websites. And Flexbox is the blueprint.

The Flexbox model allows us to layout the content of our website. Not only that, it helps us create the structures needed for creating responsive websites for multiple devices.

## Flexbox Architecture

So how does Flexbox architecture work? The flex-items [Contents] are distributed along the main axis and cross axis. And, depending on the flex-direction property, the layout position changes between rows and columns.
